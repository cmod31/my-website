  <h1> Welcome to my website! </h1>
  My name is Yannik. <br> 
  This is my personal site with my <a href="/contact" class="link">links</a>, something <a href="/aboutme" class="link">about me</a> and some extra stuff.<br>
  If you are looking for them I have also some non GitHub <a href="/projects" class="link">projects</a> here.<br>
  This website is also new so there is not much here. I put anything I want on this website.
