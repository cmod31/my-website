# The Game
I played the game Longvinter for some Time now.<br>
Longvinter is a bit like the two games Animal Crossing and Rust.<br>
But it still feels like a completely different game.<br>
First you buy a fishing rod in a vending machine and then you can fish and sell them at a vending machine.<br>
Buy a tent when you have enough money and upgrade it to a House.<br>
You can defend your base and fight players with guns.<br>
But for turrets/autodefenders you'll need electricity.<br>
<br>
# Comunity and servers
There are public and private servers with different save files on each server.<br>
My server is called `[24/7 No wipes] vaporvee's Island`, is hosted on the same server as this webserver and has a [Discord server for it here](https://discord.gg/xeHbUdNGp6).<br>
I will never delete the save files so maybe i'll have the oldest server at some point.<br>
Also it gets all the updates.<br>
<br>
The comunity is very nice and helpful in the Discord and also on the Forum.<br>
So definitely take a look at this:<br>

- [Forum](https://forum.uuvana.com/t/longvinter)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/longvinter)
- [Buy the Game on Steam (only if you join my server lol)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1635450/Longvinter/)
