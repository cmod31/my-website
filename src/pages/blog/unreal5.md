Yesterday i started learning Unreal Engine 5.<br>
So obviously I'm really in the beginning so see what advanced stuff you have just at the beginning.<br>
I'm planning to make a own game together with a friend and if it works good enough we would publish it.<br>
The UI looks way better than in previous versions and feels much easier than Unity.<br>
You can use both Blueprints and C++ but because its a premade Game Engine I'll try Blueprints first and code stuff just when its necessary.<br>
You import 3D models and they just work with physics.<br> 
You can use the third person preset and the foot just works with stairs.<br>
There are also free assets for the beginning in the Unreal asset store for free sometimes but I recommend to try making own 3D models with Blender.<br>
