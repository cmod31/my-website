# My personal Website 
My personal website that i make with Astro. <br>
Astro makes it easier with components like a navbar that you can reuse and its also reducing javascript at the building proccess. I have set the framework in this Astro installation to React.js.<br><br> 
A GitHub Action runs the build script and pushes the build to the [build branch](https://github.com/cmod31/my-website/tree/build).<br> 
My server pulls this branch every minute automatically.
